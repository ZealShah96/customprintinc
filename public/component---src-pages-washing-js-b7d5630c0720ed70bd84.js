Pretreatment is essential to ensure both longevity and outstanding appearance as it prepares the surface for painting as it cleans off all the debris and oil that comes with material while fabrication and it coats the surface with iron phosphate film which protect against corrosion and promotes adhesion. Pretreatment determines the end quality of the product. In our iron phosphate wash we add fluoride additive to promote adhesion on aluminum parts as it etches the surface of aluminum. Plastic parts are washed with an alcohol based solution."},{subheader:"Washing Systems:",message:"We have state of the art washing system as the equipment in our facility washboothhas been customized to optimize time and accuracy, therefore resulting in better turnaround with better finish.
